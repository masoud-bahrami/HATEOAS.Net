**# HATEOAS.Net**

 **[Hypermedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypermedia)** is the core component of REST API. Whiteout them it's just a service which uses HTTP verbs.

 As Roy Fielding(the creator of REST Architecture) states his 2000 PhD dissertation ( "Architectural Styles and the Design of Network-based Software Architectures") an REST Architecture has some design constrains. 

Roy defined it as:

> *REST's client-server  [separation of concerns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_concerns) simplifies component implementation, reduces the complexity of connector semantics, improves the effectiveness of performance tuning, and increases the scalability of pure server components. Layered system constraints allow intermediaries—[proxies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proxy_server), [gateways](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gateway_(telecommunications)), and [firewalls](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firewall_(computing))—to be introduced at various points in the communication without changing the interfaces between components, thus allowing them to assist in communication translation or improve performance via large-scale, shared caching. REST enables intermediate processing by constraining messages to be self-descriptive: interaction is stateless between requests, standard methods and media types are used to indicate semantics and exchange information, and responses explicitly indicate [cacheability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_cache).*

--[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer)

Constrains specified by Roy are: 

1. Client-server architecture

2. Statelessness

3. Cacheability

4. Layered system

5. Code on demand (optional)

6. Uniform interface

   Uniform interface have some constrains :

   ​	**Resource identification in requests**

   ​	**Resource manipulation through representations**

   ​	**Self-descriptive messages**

   ​	**Hypermedia as the engine of application state (HATEOAS)**

   

------

**HATEOAS** 

HATEOAS is mean having access to just entry point of any *Resource Endpoint*, as a human or system, you should be able to discover all services provided by the server, and how to communicate with server. A REST client needs little to no prior knowledge about how to interact with an application or server beyond a generic understanding of hypermedia.

REST Architecture lets you rich http responses using hypermedia links to gives the REST client chances to dynamically travers provided services using this links.

 **HATEOAS.Net**
 
 **HATEOAS.Net** contains some implementations of HATEOAS in C#  based on different specifications. Different solutions have been proposed for the use of hypertexts. Hypertext Application Language(HAL) is one of these solutions. 
 HAL is a simple and very popular way to inject hypertexts into http responses based on JSON format. HAL is [drafted](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-kelly-json-hal-08) by  [Mike Kelly](mike@stateless.co).

 **HATEOAS.Net.HAL**
 
 **HATEOAS.Net.HAL** is an agile, simple, lightweight and easy to use HAL specification for .NET developers. It also added some optional but very useful features to the HAL specification:
 1. Adding **HTTP verbs** to the link. (The link can be richer by adding HTTP verbs(GET, POST, DELETE and ...))
 2. Adding **Query Parameters** to the link. (The link can be more useful by specifying its parameters)
 
 ------
 **How to use HATEOAS.Net.HAL**
 
 Every http response is contains 3 main parts.
 1. **State** (State is the resource which exposed by the REST API. For example order.)
 2. **Hypertexts** (Hypertexts is represented as links.)
 3. **Embedded State with Hypertexts** (Embedded State is when the response is a collection of states or the response has some related resources wich client is care about it.)
 
 
 **HATEOAS.Net.HAL** provided a simple fluent builder to generate a HAP response
 
 ```
                HAL.Builder()
                .WithState(new { Name = "Masoud", Familty = "Bahrami", Age = 28 }) // State or Resource
                .WithSelfLink("/person/20", HttpVerbs.GET, false) //Hypertext
                .WithFirstLink("/person/first", HttpVerbs.GET, false)//Hypertext
                .WithLastLink("/person/last", HttpVerbs.GET, false)//Hypertext
                .WithLink(new LinkObject("test"){Links = new List<Link> //Hypertext
                {
                    Link.New("asd").WithQueryParameter(ScalarQueryParameter.NewBoolean("has" , 2))
                        .WithQueryParameter(ScalarQueryParameter.NewNumber("age" , 1))
                }
                })
                .WithEmbedded(new Embedded("ed:orders") //Embedded 
                                    .WithResource(EmbeddedResource.New(masoud)
                                    .WithSelfLink("/orders/123", HttpVerbs.GET)
                                    .WithLinkObject("basket", "/orders/123", HttpVerbs.GET))
                             )
                .WithEmbedded(new Embedded("ed:saba") //Embedded 
                    .WithResource(EmbeddedResource.New(masoud)
                        .WithSelfLink("/orders/123", HttpVerbs.GET)
                        .WithLinkObject("basket", "/orders/123", HttpVerbs.GET))
                )

                .Build();
 ```
  
  Also for the case of simplicity state object can be inherited from:
  ```
  public interface IState
    {
        List<LinkObject> LinkObjects { get; }

        object GetState();
    }
  ```
  and embedded states can be inherited from:
  ```
  public interface IEmbededState
    {
        string ResourceName { get;}

        ICollection<IState> States { get; }
    }
  ```
So we can more easily generate the HAL Response:
```
                 HAL.Builder()
                .WithState(person)
                .WithEmbededState(embeddedCollection)
                .Build();
```

**How to use Links**

 Every links have some specifications:
 
 1. HRef. Its value is either a URI [RFC3986] or a URI Template [RFC6570]
 2. HTTP Verb. Its value is string, and is used to specify the HttpVerb of the link(action method).
 3. Is Templated. Its value is boolean and SHOULD be true when the HRef is a URI template (/orders/{id})
 4. Name. Its value MAY be used as a secondary key for selecting HRef Objects
 5. Type. Its value is a string used as a hint to indicate the media type expected when dereferencing the target resource.
 6. Deprecation. Its presence indicates that the link is to be deprecated(i.e. removed)
 7. Query Parameters. Its value is a collection of "ScalarQueryParameter", and is used to specify the QueryParameters of the link(action method).
 
 HTTP Verbs should be one of this verbs:
 ```
 public class HttpVerbs
    {
        /// <summary>
        /// The GET method requests a representation of the specified resource.
        /// Requests using GET should only retrieve data.
        /// </summary>
        public static string GET = "GET";
        /// <summary>
        /// The HEAD method asks for a response identical to that of a GET request,
        /// but without the response body.
        /// </summary>
        public static string HEAD = "HEAD";
        /// <summary>
        /// The POST method is used to submit an entity to the specified resource, often causing a change in state or side effects on the server.
        /// </summary>
        public static string POST = "POST";
        /// <summary>
        /// The PUT method replaces all current representations of the target resource with the request payload.
        /// </summary>
        public static string PUT = "PUT";
        /// <summary>
        /// The DELETE method deletes the specified resource.
        /// </summary>
        public static string DELETE = "DELETE";
        /// <summary>
        /// The CONNECT method establishes a tunnel to the server identified by the target resource.
        /// </summary>
        public static string CONNECT = "CONNECT";
        /// <summary>
        /// The OPTIONS method is used to describe the communication options for the target resource.
        /// </summary>
        public static string OPTIONS = "OPTIONS";
        /// <summary>
        /// The TRACE method performs a message loop-back test along the path to the target resource.
        /// </summary>
        public static string TRACE = "TRACE";
        /// <summary>
        /// The PATCH method is used to apply partial modifications to a resource.
        /// </summary>
        public static string PATCH = "PATCH";

    }
 ```
 For every http verbs there is a helper method to create a new links:
 ```
 Link.NewGET("/orders"); // Create a new GET link
 Link.NewPOST("/orders");// Create a new POST link
 Link.NewCONNECT("/orders");// Create a new CONNECT link
 Link.NewDELETE("/orders");// Create a new DELETE link
 Link.NewHEAD("/orders");// Create a new HEAD link
 Link.NewOPTIONS("/orders");// Create a new OPTIONS link
 Link.NewPATCH("/orders");// Create a new PATCH link
 Link.NewPUT("/orders");// Create a new PUT link
 Link.NewTRACE("/orders");// Create a new TRACE link
 ```
 Adding query parameters to the link. Every query parameters have some fueatures. Its name, position and type. The position is the location of the parameter in the URL, for example the first parameter is name or the secound parameter is age.Type can be one of this:
 ```
 enum QueryParameterType
    {
        String,
        Boolean,
        Number,
        DateTime,
        Char,
        Enum,
        Object,
        Collection
    }
 ```
 
 To define a new query parameter we should use this class:
 ```
 ScalarQueryParameter.NewString(string title, short position);
 ScalarQueryParameter.NewBoolean(string title, short position);
 ScalarQueryParameter.NewNumber(string title, short position);
 ScalarQueryParameter.NewDateTime(string title, short position);
 ScalarQueryParameter.NewChar(string title, short position);
 ```
 
 Adding the parameter to the link:
 ```
 Link.NewTRACE("/orders/{id}")
                    .WithQueryParameter(ScalarQueryParameter.NewBoolean("isAdmin", 1));
```
